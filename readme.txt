Flash 2.0
A P-Roc project to convert a 1979 Williams Flash to a P-roc pinball machine.

The basic goal is to have the machine retain it's outward appearance, including the original plasma six digit displays, while replacing the aging MPU and driver boards with modern replacment that allow for custom programming.  As a side goal, the changes were intended to be completely reversable in case I found the need to pull the P-roc board, and use it in another project.


The hardware changes consist of a Proc board, and a custom Proc driver board intended for conversion of Williams system 11 machines.  More information on my hardware setup can be found here:  http://www.pinballcontrollers.com/forum/index.php?topic=1512.0

The diplay driver will be an Arduino Uno that I built and set up to take commands over USB.  On my todo list is to post the Arduino code.
